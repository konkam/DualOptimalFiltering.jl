This is the README for reproducing the figures from the article Kon Kam King, G., Pandolfi, A., Piretto, M., & Ruggiero, M. (2024). Approximate filtering via discrete dual processes. Stochastic Processes and Their Applications, 168, 104268.

It describes the Julia and R scripts used to generate the figures in the article, as well as the Makefile used to run them.

## Requirements

- Julia 1.8
- R >= 4.0 with package tidyverse

You may need to input the following command to download and install the relevant Julia packages: 

julia +1.8 --project=. -e "using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()"

For more information or troubleshooting, background information about environment management in Julia is available at https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/


Note: the script scripts_for_figures/filtering_error_computation_WF.jl requires a significant amount of RAM memory. The code has been run on a cluster, if you wish to run it on your personal computer make sure you have a sufficient amount of RAM available.
